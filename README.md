# Bitbucket Scala client

This is a simple library that aims to have basic functions of the Bitbucket API.
This library is meant to support Codacy when interacting with Bitbucket.

### Usage

Import on SBT:

    "com.codacy" %% "bitbucket-scala-client" % "<VERSION>"

To build the `BitbucketClient` you need to pass a builder function from Unit => WSClient

#### Play 2.4

```Scala
import com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpClientConfig
import play.api.libs.ws.ning.{NingAsyncHttpClientConfigBuilder, NingWSClient}

() => {
  val config = new NingAsyncHttpClientConfigBuilder().build()
  val clientConfig = new AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder(config).build()
  val client = new NingWSClient(clientConfig)
}
```

#### Play 2.7

```Scala
import akka.stream.Materializer
import play.api.libs.ws.ahc.AhcWSClient

() => {
  //You need to have an implicit Materializer in scope
  AhcWSClient()
}
```
